## Tools & Calculators

The user is provided with 4 tools/intents:

* Set workout alarm
* Tweet your workout
* Find a gym, and
* Fit tips.

A ViewPager provides the user the option to swipe left or right to navigate from these tools to 2 calculators.

### RFM Calculator

The user is provided with a calculator to input height, waist circumference, and gender in order to receive a personalized interpretation of health status according to the **Relative Fat Mass Index** created by [Cedars-Sinai Medical Center](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/blog/relative-fat-mass.html).

This is considered to be a [more accurate measure](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/cedars-sinai-investigators-develop-more-accurate-measure-of-body-fat/) of body fat than BMI.

### BMI Calculator

The user is also provided with a calculator to input height and weight in order to receive a personalized interpretation of health status according to the traditional **Body Mass Index**. Interpretation of results was sourced from the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html#InterpretedAdults).
